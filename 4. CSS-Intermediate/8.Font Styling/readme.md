Font Styling is the class for the font changing in the web app

We will learn the Font Family 
cursive and fantacy we are not going to use anywhere because due to no readability

whenever we put font-family with comma first argument will tell the font to convert and seccond will tell the default font.

TO avoid the fallback we can use the font embedding.

Select all the fonts from goolge fonts and copy the link and paste in html link tag inside head.
